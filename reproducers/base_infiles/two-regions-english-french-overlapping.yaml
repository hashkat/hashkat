# >> analysis:
#
# Attributes for controlling the duration and type of analysis.
#  initial_agents:
#    The initial number of agents in the network.
#  max_agents: 
#    The maximum amount of agents for which to allocate. Once the network
#    has grown to this amount, the agent add rate will artifically drop to 0.
#  max_time:
#    The maximum simulation-time for the simulation. Once it has elapsed, the simulation halts.
#    Interacting with the simulation does not alter the simulation-time.
#    In simulated minutes.
#  max_analysis_steps:
#    The maximum number of steps to be made in the KMC loop. For superior results, set this value to 'unlimited'.
#  max_real_time:
#    The maximum real-time for the simulation. Once it has elapsed, the simulation halts.
#    Note that interacting with the simulation DOES detract from this time.
#    In minutes.
#  enable_interactive_mode:
#    Whether interactive mode should be triggered by Ctrl+c or ./scripts/stop.sh (triggers SIGUSR1).
#  enable_lua_hooks:
#    Whether to use runtime Lua functions that can react to events. **Slow!**
#    Hooks are available for running on every tweet, retweet, follow, etc.
#  lua_script:
#    Script to use to define the behaviour of interactive mode as well as lua hooks.
#  use_barabasi: 
#    If true, agents will make a certain number of connections set by barabasi_connections.
#  barabasi_exponent:
#    The value of the exponent assigned to each agent's cumulative-degree.
#  use_random_time_increment: 
#    If true, simulation time will be incremented at a non-constant rate. Increments by 1/sum(rates) on average
#  use_followback: 
#    Whether to enable follow-back in the simulation.
#  use_follow_via_retweets:
#    Whether to enable following via retweets in the simulation.
#  follow_model: 
#    Accepted models: 'random', 'twitter_suggest', 'agent', 'preferential_agent', 'hashtag', 'twitter'
#  model_weights:
#    The normalized probability of calling each follow model for the 'twitter' follow model.
#  stage1_unfollow: 
#    If set to true, an agent will unfollow a 'chatty' agent if the chatty agents tweets at 
#    twice the average rate of the other agents the receiving agent follows. Chattiness determined 
#    relative to the receiving agent.
#  unfollow_tweet_rate: 
#    Absolute threshold for tweets per minute.  After this point the tweeter will lose a random follower.
#  use_hashtag_probability:
#    The probability that tweets will contain a hashtag.

# >> tweet_observation: 
#
# An observation probability density function that gives 
# the probability that a tweet is observed at a certain time by an 'ideal observer'. 
# An 'ideal observer' is one which always sees a tweet, eventually.'
# The observation PDF is used for both retweeting and follow-from-tweet.
# We combine this with a relevance factor, r, where 0.0 <= r <= 1.0. We in turn
# determine the probability that a given agent will act on a given tweet, with enough time.
#
#  density_function:
#    Probability 'density' function to sample logarithmatically.
#    Provided as if a Python function of 'x'. It is integrated, and after integration,
#    the function will be normalized for you. 
#    Note: technically not a true PDF because one does NOT need to have an integral range that sums to 1.0.
#
#  x_start:
#    In arbitrary units. The beginning x-value to integrate from.
#  x_end:
#    In arbitrary units. The end x-value to integrate to.
#
#  initial_resolution:
#    In arbitrary units. The initial binning resolution. 
#    That is, the x-step with which to begin binning. The binning resolution is decreased from there on.
#  resolution_growth_factor:
#    How quickly the resolution grows from one bin to the next. 
#    Quicker is more efficient, but with less precise rates in later bins.
#  time_span:
#    In simulated minutes. The time over which the function is defined.
#    After this, tweets will 'disappear'.
