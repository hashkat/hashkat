# Input

Hello world

This page lists all user modifiable configurations in the input file **INFILE.yaml**. 

## Analysis

Let's go over what each variable means.

#### Initial Agents

```python
initial_agents: 20
```

The initial_agents are the agents you will have at the start of the simulation. In the above case, this value is 20.

#### Max Agents

```python 
max_agents: 100001
```

This is the maximum number of users that are permitted in the simulation. Once this number is reached, the number of agents in the network will no longer increase. In this case we can see the value is 100001.

#### Max Time

```python 
max_time:  hour
```

This variable refers to the maximum **simulated** time in **minutes** for the simulation to run.  You may also describe time as 'minute', 'hour', 'day', or 'year', multiplied by a constant, or each other, and **#k@** will convert the value to minutes (e.g. 3 days can be input as __3*day__, which is equal to 4,320 minutes). 

Note: interacting with the network simulation DOES NOT affect simulated time elapsed.

#### Max Analysis Steps

```python 
max_analysis_steps: unlimited
```

This is the maximum number of loops undertaken in the the simulation. To achieve the most accurate results possible, it is recommended to keep this value at unlimited.

#### Max Real Time

```python 
max_real_time:   hour
```

This sets the maximum **actual** time you will permit the simulation to run. This time is in **seconds**, and may be input in the same way as 'max_time' above.  Once actual time has elapsed, the simulation ends. 

Note: interacting with the network simulation during the run DOES affect real time elapsed.


#### Enable Interactive Mode

```python 
enable_interactive_mode:  true
```

If 'true', the user may interact with the simulation while it is running, while 'false' prevents interaction.

#### Enable Lua Hooks

```python 
enable_lua_hooks: false
```

If set to 'true', runtime Lua functions are enabled that can react to events such as a 'tweet', 'retweet', or 'follow'. 

Note: setting this to 'true' will slow down the simulation immensely.

#### Lua Script

```python 
lua_script: INTERACT.lua
```
'lua_script' contains all the script for interactive mode. It is highly recommended to keep this variable as 'INTERACT.lua', since that is the default Lua script in the **#k@** directory.

#### Use Barabasi

```python 
use_barabasi:  false
```

A setting of 'false' allows agents in the simulation to 'follow' as many other agents as the simulation allows.  If this variable is set to 'true', the user may impose a maximum number of connections in **barabasi_connections** below.

#### Barabasi Connections

```python 
barabasi_connections:  100
```

Note: if **use_barabasi** is set to 'true', the number of follows an agent may make in a network simulation is limited to the value given.

For a Classic Barabasi configuration, set this value equal to 1. 

For a Non-Classic Barabasi configuration, set this value greater than 1.

#### Barabasi Exponent

```python 
barabasi_exponent:  1
```

The value assigned to the exponent of every agent's **cumulative_degree** within the network.

#### Use Random Time Increment

```python 
use_random_time_increment: true
```

If set to 'true' time increases in random increments modelled by the **KMC** loop.  An input of 'false' makes time increase by a constant value. A setting of 'true' generally gives more refined results.

#### Use Followback

```python 
use_followback: true
```

If set to 'true', agents are permitted to follow agents who follow them.  

#### Use Follow via Retweets

```python 
use_follow_via_retweets:  true
```

Input 'true' into **use_follow_via_retweets** to allow Agent C to follow Agent A based on Agent C receiving a retweet of Agent A's tweet from Agent B. The probability that Agent C will follow Agent A is directly proportional to how popular Agent A is.

#### Follow Model

```python 
follow_model:  random
```

The options for follow model are: **random**, **twitter_suggest**, **agent**, **preferential_agent**, **hashtag**, and **twitter**.  

The follow model determines how agents chose whom to follow and will have a significant effect on the outcome of your simulation.

A **random** follow model will result in an agent following another at random.  A **twitter_suggest** follow model will result in an agent following another based on how popular the other is. The **agent** follow model will have agents follow agents of a certain type.  Within that type, following is at random. The **preferential_agent** follow model will have agents follow agents of a certain type.  Within that type, following is based on the popularity of the agent.  The **hashtag** model will have agents follow based upon hashtags that suit their interests.  The **twitter** model is a combination of the five other models (see **Model Weights** below).

#### Model Weights

```python 
model_weights: 
{random: 0.20, twitter_suggest: 0.20, agent: 0.20, preferential_agent: 0.20, hashtag: 0.20}
```

This variable is relevant when using the **twitter** follow model, which is a combination of all the other follow models.  This variable allows weighting of each follow model in the simulation, to a maximum combined weight of 1.0.

#### Stage1 Unfollow

```python 
stage1_unfollow: false
```

Inputting 'true' enables agents to 'unfollow' agents that have a tweet rate double the average tweet rate of the other agents followed by the agent. In other words, this variable allows Agent B to deliberately unfollow Agent A for 'chattiness', where 'chattiness' is defined as exceeding a **relative average** tweet rate, calculated based on the sub-set of agents that Agent B follows.  

Inputting 'false' prevents an agent from unfollowing for 'chattiness'.

#### Unfollow Tweet Rate

```python 
unfollow_tweet_rate: 10
```

The unfollow_tweet_rate describes a **constant** tweet rate that, if exceeded by the tweeter, Agent A, will cause the Agent A to **randomly** lose a follower. 

To prevent this, set the unfollow_tweet_rate much greater than the typical agent 'tweet_rate' in the simulation.

#### Use Hashtag Probability

```python 
use_hashtag_probability:  1
```

The probability of a tweet containing a hashtag(**#**) may range from 0 to 1.  Hashtags enable agents with the **hashtag follow model** enabled to follow new agents unconnected to their network.

#### Rates

The 'add' rate is the rate at which new agents will be added per minute during the simulation. This function can be constant or linear.

```python 
rates:  add: {function: constant, value: 0.0}
```

For a constant 'add' rate, the function must be identified as **constant** and the number of agents you wish to add per simulated minute is the 'value'. This number can zero or greater.  Although described as constant this function describes a rate.  A zero rate would not add agents during the simulation.

```python 
rates:  add: {function: linear, y_intercept: 1.0, slope: 0.1}
```

For a linear 'add' function, the slope and y-intercept must be specified.  The classic linear function is **y = ax + b**, where **'a'** is the slope, **'x'** the variable, and **'b'** the y-intercept. 

In **#k@**, the 'y_intercept' is the initial rate at which agents are added (the 'value' of the constant function above).  The 'slope' is the rate at which the 'add' rate increases over time, where time ('x') is in simulated months.

The 'follow' and 'retweet' rates work in the same manner.

## Output

This section describes how to initialize your Output settings in the **INFILE.yaml**.  Initially it is recommended to set all these variables to 'true'.  With more experience, unnecessary output variables can be set to 'false'.

The information received as **Output** is further discussed in the **Output** tab of the documentation.  

#### Save Network on Timeout

```python 
save_network_on_timeout: true
```

If 'true', all of the simulated network data will be stored in the **save_file** outlined below should a timeout occur.

#### Load Network on Startup

```python 
load_network_on_startup: true
```

If 'true', all of the data stored in the **save_file** will be loaded when the network simulation recommences, and the simulation will continue. If 'false', the simulation will simply restart from the beginning.

#### Ignore Load Config Check

```python 
ignore_load_config_check: true
```

If 'true', allows you to load a network from the **save_file** and continue the simulation using an input file with different parameters. Setting this to 'false' will prevent you from doing this.

#### Save File

```python 
save_file: network_state.dat
```

Determines the name of the file where the simulated data will be saved to.


#### Stdout Basic

```python 
stdout_basic: true
```

If 'true', when a network simulation is stopped or completed, a message will print to the screen.  If the simulation ends, the message will state why the simulation ended, that analysis files are being created, and that analysis can be aborted by pressing **Ctrl-c** multiple times.  If the analysis files have been created, the message will state the analysis is complete.

#### Stdout Summary

```python 
stdout_summary:  true
```

If 'true', the length of simulated time (in simulated minutes), the number of agents, 'follows', 'tweets', 'retweets', and 'unfollows', the cumulative rate function **R**, and the real time elapsed in seconds during the simulation will be displayed on the screen **throughout** the simulation's run. This information is updated at a rate determined by the **summary_output_rate** described below.

#### Summary Output Rate

```python 
summary_output_rate:   100 
```

This defines how often the **stdout_summary** information will be updated on screen during a simulation.  The value is based on the loops in the **KMC**. In this case, we can see that information will update every hundred loops or steps.

#### Visualize

```python 
visualize:  true
```

If 'true', the simulation will output two additional output files, **network.dat** and **network.gexf**. The file **network.dat** shows every individual follower each agent has. The file **network.gexf** can be used to visualize simulated networks with third party programs such as [Gephi](http://gephi.github.io/).

#### Agent Stats

```python 
agent_stats:  true
```

If 'true', the simulation will produce additional output files for each 'agent type' within the simulation, as **agenttype_info.dat** (i.e. a 'Standard' agent type will result in the file **Standard_info.dat**).

#### Degree Distributions

```python 
degree_distributions:  true
```

If 'true', the 'in-degree', 'out-degree', and 'cumulative-degree' distributions will be output with a file for each simulated month. In the case of the zeroth month, the 'in-degree' file would be called **in-degree_distribution_month_000.dat**.

#### Tweet Analysis

```python 
tweet_analysis:  true
```

Setting to 'true' creates two output files, **tweets_distro.dat** and **retweets_distro.dat**, which contain the distributions for the tweets and retweets that agents have made in the network simulation.

#### Retweet Visualization

```python 
retweet_visualization:  true
```

If 'true', the network simulation will produce an output file titled **retweet_viz.gexf**, which can be used to visualize the most popular tweet (most 'retweeted') in third party programs such as [Gephi](http://gephi.github.io/).

#### Main Statistics

```python 
main_statistics:  true
```

Setting to 'true' creates the **main_stats.dat** output file, which contains all principal information from a given simulation.

#### Degree Distribution by Follow Model

```python 
degree_distribution_by_follow_model: true
```

If 'true', creates the **dd_by_follow_model.dat** output file which shows the normalized probability and the normalized probability logarithm that an agent of a particular cumulative-degree made its connections via each particular follow method.

#### Region Connection Matrix

```python 
region_connection_matrix:  true
```

Setting to 'true' creates the **region_connection_matrix.dat** output file, which contains a chart showing the connections made between regions.

#### Categories Distribution

```python 
categories_distro:  true
```

If 'true', creates the **Categories_Distro.dat** output file, which shows how many agents have made a certain number of tweets and retweets and how many agents have a particular number of followers.

#### Most Popular Tweet Content

```python 
most_popular_tweet_content:  true
```

Setting to 'true' creates the **most_popular_tweet_content.dat** output file, which contains details on the most retweeted tweet and its author.

## Ranks

This section details how agents may be ranked according to their number of tweets, retweets, and number of followers.

#### Tweet Ranks

```python 
tweet_ranks: thresholds: {bin_spacing: linear, min: 10, max: 300, increment: 10}
```

Serves as a way to categorize agents by their number of tweets. The 'bin_spacing' may be **linear**, **quadratic**, or **cubic**, which means that bins can be spaced by the 'increment' raised to the power of 1, 2, or 3 respectively. The **tweet_ranks** can also be set with a minimum, maximum, and increment value. 

In the above case, with tweeting enabled, agents with 10 or less tweets will be stored on a list in the initial bin. If some of these agents continue to tweet, and end up having a total number of tweets greater than 10 but less than 20, they will move to the next bin. Agents can keep moving bins until they have made (in this case) 291 tweets, since they will be placed in the final bin where agents with 300 or less tweets are placed and remain there. If tweeting is disabled, the number of agents in each tweet rank wll be listed as zero.

#### Retweet Ranks

```python 
retweet_ranks: thresholds: {bin_spacing: linear, min: 10, max: 300, increment: 10}
```

Similarly, this case categorizes agents based on their number of retweets.

#### Follow Ranks

```python 
follow_ranks:  
thresholds: {bin_spacing: linear, min: 0, max: 100001, increment: 1}
weights:    {bin_spacing: linear, min: 1, max: 100000, increment: 1}
```

This rank serves to categorize agents based on the number of followers they have. However the bins are weighted. Here the bins have a weight equal to its corresponding value increased by 1 (assuming the 'bin_spacing' is 'linear' and 'increment' is 1). 

The weights are essential in the **twitter_suggest** (combination) and **preferential_agent** follow models, since they are what cause agents with a higher 'in-degree' (number of followers) to have a better chance of being followed than agents with fewer followers. 

## Tweet Observations

Tweets lose relevance over time, to the point where they will no longer be retweeted. This section deals with the decay function for retweet rates.

#### Density Function

```python 
density_function: 2.45 / (x)**1.1
```

This is the function which describes how retweet rates decay over time.  This function is integrated and each discrete element is divided by the total integral to normalize the function and ensure that it truly is a [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function).  Agents that can still be retweeted are binned according to the values determined by this function. As time progresses, they are moved to bins of smaller retweet rates. The discrete elements of this function can be adjusted below.

#### x_start

```python 
x_start:  5
```

This is the initial value of the density function. Make sure that the value you choose for **x** does not cause a discontinuity (e.g. using **x = 0** would cause the above density function to be divided by 0, causing a discontinuity).

#### x_end

```python 
x_end:  600
```

This is the final value of the density function. Make sure that this value does not cause a discontinuity in the function.

#### Initial Resolution

```python 
initial_resolution:  1.0
```

Determines the initial boundary spacing for integration of the density function. For example, here we have 'initial resolution' equal to 1.0 and 'x_start' equal to 5, so we could expect the first integral to be bounded from 5 to 6 [5,6]

#### Resolution Growth Factor

```python 
resolution_growth_factor:  1.05
```

Determines the density function integral boundary spacing after the initial resolution. This has been implemented due to a function resolution needing to be much more accurate during the time immediately after a tweet is tweeted as opposed to some time after this has occurred. If you had an 'initial_resolution' of 1.0, a 'resolution_growth_factor' of 1.05 and an 'x_start' of 5, the integrals would be evaluated at [5,6], [6, 7.05], [7.05, 8.10], etc. 

#### Time Span

```python 
time_span:  8*hour
```

Determines for how long after a tweet has been made that it can be retweeted. Once this simulated time has elapsed, the density function will disappear, allowing no more retweets or following via retweets to occur for this tweet.

## Agent Attributes

Agents may be given different attributes such as **agent_types**, **ideology**, **regions**, and **preference_class**.  

In **#k@** the number of the attributes are found in the **config_static.h ** file in the **src** directory:

`~\hashkat\src\config_static.h`
	
	N_BIN_IDEOLOGIES = 4;
	N_BIN_PREFERENCE_CLASS = 2;
	N_BIN_REGIONS = 3;
	N_BIN_AGENT_TYPES = 200;

**Language** is also an attribute. It is treated an enumerated class, in the same file.  

If a greater number of any BIN is desired, the value of the **N_BIN** file must be changed and **#k@** must be rebuilt before the simulation can be run. 

To build **#k@**, run:

`./build.sh -O`

The values of the attributes are configured through **INFILE.yaml**.  

#### Ideologies

Ideologies are named after colours in **#k@**. The names may be changed. 

Through **INFILE.yaml** the simulation may configure 0-4 **ideologies**.  

Note: if you'd like to increase the number of ideologies in the simulation, change the value set in the **N_BIN** file.  If **N_BIN** is changed, remember to then rebuild **#k@** to have these changes take effect.

#### Preference Classes

The **preference classes** detail how agents react to tweets in a network simulation. 

The four possible types of tweets are: 'plain', 'musical', 'ideological', and 'humorous'. 

```python
- name: StandardPref

   tweet_transmission:
      plain:
        Standard: 0.5
        Celebrity: 1.0
      different_ideology:
        all: 0.0        
      same_ideology:
        Standard: 0.3
        else: 0.6
      humorous:
        Standard: 1.0
        Celebrity: 1.0
        else: 0.0
```

Under **tweet_transmission** one can specify the probability that tweets made by a particular 'agent type' ('Standard', 'Celebrity') will be retweeted based on the content of that tweet. Instead of inserting a particular 'agent type', one can also input 'all' or 'else' for any of the **tweet_transmision** rates.

Note: if you'd like to increase the number of preference classes in the simulation, change the value set in the **N_BIN** file.  If **N_BIN** is changed, remember to then rebuild **#k@** to have these changes take effect.


#### Regions

**#k@** has permits three regions, defined in **INFILE.yaml**.  The names and attributes of the regions may be changed by the user.

```python
- name: Ontario
    add_weight: 1
    preference_class_weights: {StandardPref: 100, NoRetweetPref: 100}
    ideology_weights: {Red: 100, Blue: 100}
    language_weights: {English: 50, French: 25, French+English: 25}
```

A region's **add_weight** corresponds to the probability that an agent added to the network is from that region, and is weighted with respect to the sum of the **add_weights** of all the regions. 

The **preference_class_weights** are the possible 'preference classes' agents from that region can have, and are weighted with respect to one another. 

The **ideology_weights** are the possible 'ideologies' agents can have, and are weighted with respect to one another. 

The **language_weights** are the possible 'languages' that an agent from that region can speak, and are weighted with respect to each other.

Note: make sure the number of regions is EXACTLY equal to the value set for **N_BIN_REGIONS**.  You may change the value of the **N_BIN**, but remember to then rebuild **#k@** to have these changes take effect.

## Agent Types

Agents are defined as **Standard** or **Celebrity**.  **Standard** agents may be further configured as **Organizations** and **Bots** each of which have different behavior patterns from the typical **Standard** agent.  As an example, a **Celebrity** does not typically 'follow back' while an **Organization** always will.  

The specified behavior of each type sets it apart.  In a normal build, the user may define from 1 to 200 agent types, although 200 types can be costly in terms of memory. 

Note: one may increase the number of agent types in the simulation by increasing the value in the **N_BIN**, but make sure to then rebuild **#k@** for these changes to take effect.


```python
- name: Standard
    weights:
      add: 80
      follow: 5
      tweet_type:
        ideological: 1.0
        plain: 1.0
        musical: 1.0
        humorous: 1.0
    followback_probability: 0.44
    hashtag_follow_options:
      care_about_region: true
      care_about_ideology: false
    rates:
        follow: {function: constant, value: 0.1}
        tweet: {function: constant, value: 0.01}
```

#### Weights

Under weights we can see **add**, which correlates to the probability, weighted against the sum of the **add** weights of all the agent types, that a new agent added is of this type. 

The value input into **follow** will be the probability, weighted against the **follow** weights of all the other agent types, that an agent of this type will be the one followed in the **agent_follow model** when a follow occurs. 

#### Tweet Types

There are four tweet types in **#k@**.  These are **plain**, **political**, **humorous** and **musical**.  The weights of the tweet types are summarized to create a weighted probability of the type of the agent's next tweet.  In the above case, each type of tweet has a 1/4 chance of occurring. 

The type of tweet is relevant to the dissemination of the tweet.  **Plain** tweets may only have meaning to an agent's followers and may not be retweeted.  **Political** tweets may be relevant only to agents of the same region and language.  **Humorous** tweets may attract followers of the same language in different regions, and the appeal of **musical** tweets may transcend region and language. 

#### Follow Back Probability

The followback_probability is the probability from 0-1 that following this type of agent will 'follow back' if followed.  For a **Celebrity** this value would be 0, in an **Organization** this value would be 1.  

Note: **use_followback** must be enabled for 'follow back probability' to have any effect. 

#### Hashtag Follow Options

The hashtag follow options are implemented in the **hashtag follow model**, where agents follow other agents based on the hashtags present in their tweets. In this follow model, if **care_about_region** is set to 'true', agents of this type will only follow other agents from the same region.  If **care_about_ideology** is set to 'true', agents will only follow agents that share their ideology. 

Note: **use_hashtag_probability** must not be zero.

#### Rates 

The 'follow' and 'tweet' rates are the rates at which agents of this particular agent type will follow and tweet per simulated minute. These work in the same manner (**constant** or **linear**) as the 'add' rate in the **Rates** section at the start of this document.
