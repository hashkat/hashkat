BUG:  LANGUAGE
Error:  49, 53, 101, 104, 105
Enhancement:  80, 94

Definitions:

active Region = region has positive (non zero) add_weight

Problem:

When ENGLISH language is set to zero (language_weight = 0) in every active region, no tweets become ACTIVE, which means no RETWEETS happen.

To recreate this bug, take any INFILE you want - including DEFAULT.

Change ENGLISH language_weight to 0 in all regions that have a positive add_weight.

./run.sh


Enhancement:

When rebuilding language, suggest:

- language have generic naming structure (#80) ie A, B, C, A+B, B+C, A+B+C
- language naming be either modifiable or generic (like ideology)

In general:

- more output on language, region & ideology would make testing & QA easier.
