tweet_observation: # 'Omega'
   # Configures an observation probability density function that gives 
   # the probability that a tweet is observed at a certain time by an 'ideal observer'. 
   # An 'ideal observer' is one which always sees a tweet, eventually.'
   # The observation PDF is used for both retweeting and follow-from-tweet.
   # We combine this with a relevance factor, r, where 0 <= r <= 1.0, we in turn
   # determines the probability that a given entity will act on a given tweet.
